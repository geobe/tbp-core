# Core classes for the TimeBudgetPlanning Project
Core classes for a Spring Boot project with a Vaadin UI. 
Start with a monolith, then split it into microservices.
The UI will migrate to a separate microservice when project evolves.

## Used supporting projects
The project uses other projects that must be imported from github:
* [associations](https://github.com/geobe/associations)
* [state-machine](https://github.com/geobe/state-machine)
* [vaadin-builder](https://github.com/geobe/vaadin-builder)
